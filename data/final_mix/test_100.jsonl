Thus there are ${n \\choose k}$ numbers that have $n+1$ digits in base $2$ notation, with $k+1$ of the digits being $1$'s.\nIn order for there to be more $1$'s than $0$'s, we must have $k+1 > \\frac{d+1}{2} \\Longrightarrow k > \\frac{d-1}{2} \\Longrightarrow k \\ge \\frac{d}{2}$. Therefore, the number of such numbers corresponds to the sum of all numbers on or to the right of the vertical line of symmetry in Pascal's Triangle, from rows $0$ to $10$ (as $2003 < 2^{11}-1$). Since the sum of the elements of the $r$th row is $2^r$, it follows that the sum of all elements in rows $0$ through $10$ is $2^0 + 2^1 + \\cdots + 2^{10} = 2^{11}-1 = 2047$.
